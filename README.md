Tips and Tricks:
- You need to calculate time, velocity and vectors to use this variables and optimise the behaviour of the pods (I've used StopWatch object to record the time that has a good performance to it).
- You can record all the checkpoint path after the first lap and use this information in your advantage to optimize movement, mostly the rotation before landing on a checkpoint to look to the next more quickly.
